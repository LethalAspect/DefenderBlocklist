# Lethal's Filterlists

These are random filter lists that I found and wanted to maintain for personal use

Feel free to use anything here!

## To-Do/Enhancements
- [x] Add a section for WWW in iphosts (Use ipadblock.txt instead)
- [ ] Check domains if they are active or inactive
- [ ] Have the time to search for new domains
- [x] Organize the list for better look
